# LinuxOperatingSystem
Linux Programming
This repository contains all the assignments for my operating system class last semester. This course takes my understanding of computer to
a new level. I have a deeper understanding of unix operating system such as system call, kernal memory, file system, virtual memory, kernal
memory, kernal scheduler and so on. There are nine C programming assignments which interacts with linux system. Each of them represents different topics.

I will update more detail information about each assignments in separate readme files.
